SPIM/SAL is a port, to the Apple Macintosh Personal Computer, of SPIM,
a MIPS R2000/3000 simulator that was written by James Larus for
instructional use at the University of Wisconsin Computer Sciences
Departement. Three other versions of SPIM exist: a character-cell
terminal version for Unix called "spim", an X windows version for
Unix called "xspim", and a version for PC's running WIN32S, also
called "SPIM/SAL." These versions are not identical, but they are
descended from a common ancestor and offer the same general
functionality. See the end of this document for information about
obtaining the different versions of SPIM.
